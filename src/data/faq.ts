    question: 'What if I don\'t rank in the top 5 within 60 days?',
    answer: 'We continue working for free until you do. Our guarantee is ironclad - if we don\'t deliver top 5 ChatGPT ranking within 60 days, we keep working at no additional cost until you achieve that position. We\'ve delivered for 94% of clients within the 60-day window.',

    question: 'Does this replace my existing SEO efforts?',
    answer: 'No, it complements them. AI search optimization and traditional SEO work together synergistically. In fact, many of the tactics we use (like schema markup, reviews, and content) also improve your traditional search rankings. Think of this as the next evolution of SEO, not a replacement.',

    id: 'faq3',
    question: 'How do you measure AI search rankings?',
    answer: 'We use a combination of direct testing and proprietary monitoring tools. We run regular queries across ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, and other major AI platforms to track your position. You receive monthly reports showing your exact ranking position for relevant business queries in your market.',

    question: 'What makes Advera different from other marketing agencies?',
    answer: 'We specialize exclusively in AI search optimization - it\'s not a side service, it\'s our only focus. Our 7 Pillars methodology is battle-tested across hundreds of businesses. Plus, we\'re the only agency offering a guaranteed top 5 ranking with a money-back guarantee if we don\'t deliver.',

  },
  {
    id: 'faq5',
    question: 'Do I need to have a website?',
    answer: 'Yes, but it doesn\'t need to be elaborate. AI models primarily reference your Google Business Profile, review platforms, and news mentions - but having a website with proper schema markup significantly boosts your credibility. If your current site needs work, we can recommend partners who specialize in AI-optimized web design.',

    id: 'faq6',
    question: 'Can I switch plans later?',
    answer: 'Absolutely. Many clients start with Blueprint to test the waters, then upgrade to Accelerator or Concierge once they see results. We make transitions seamless, and any work completed carries over to your new plan. You can upgrade, downgrade, or pause at any time with 30 days\' notice.',

    id: 'faq7',
    question: 'What industries do you work with?',
    answer: 'We work with local and regional businesses across all industries - from healthcare and legal to home services and retail. The 7 Pillars methodology is industry-agnostic. We customize our approach based on your specific market dynamics, competition, and business goals.',
    category: 'General'
  },
  {
    id: 'faq8',
    question: 'How involved do I need to be in the process?',
    answer: 'It depends on your plan. Blueprint requires about 2-3 hours per month for check-ins and content approval. Accelerator needs 4-5 hours monthly. Concierge is nearly hands-off - just 1 hour per week for strategy calls. We handle all implementation, tracking, and optimization.',

    id: 'faq9',
    question: 'What happens after the initial 60 days?',
    answer: 'Once you hit top 5, we shift to maintenance and defense mode. AI rankings can fluctuate as competitors optimize and new businesses emerge. All plans include ongoing monitoring and optimization to protect your position. We also continue improving your ranking toward #1 if you haven\'t reached it yet.',
    category: 'Results'
  },
  {
    id: 'faq10',
    question: 'Is there a setup fee or long-term contract?',
    answer: 'No setup fees. Pricing is all-inclusive. Contracts are month-to-month after the initial 60-day guarantee period. We earn your business every month by delivering results. Most clients stay with us for 12+ months because the ROI is undeniable.',
    category: 'Pricing'
  },
  {
    id: 'faq11',
    question: 'How quickly will I see results?',
    answer: 'Most clients see movement within 2-3 weeks as we implement the foundational pillars (GBP optimization, NAP consistency, schema markup). Significant ranking improvements typically appear by week 4-6. We guarantee top 5 positioning by day 60, but 94% of our clients achieve it sooner.',
    category: 'Results'
  },
  {
    id: 'faq12',
    question: 'Do you work with businesses outside the US?',
    answer: 'Currently, we focus exclusively on US-based businesses. AI search behavior, review platforms, and local media dynamics vary significantly by country. By concentrating on the US market, we can deliver superior results with our proven methodology.',
    category: 'General'
  },
  {
    id: 'faq13',
    question: 'What if my competitors are also using AI optimization?',
    answer: 'Even better - it validates the importance of AI visibility. Our competitive advantage lies in the comprehensiveness of our 7 Pillars approach. Most competitors only implement 2-3 pillars. We\'ve consistently outranked businesses with larger marketing budgets because we execute all 7 systematically.',
    category: 'Results'

  {
    id: 'faq14',
    question: 'Can I see examples of businesses you\'ve helped?',
    answer: 'Yes. We have detailed case studies available during your strategy call. Due to confidentiality agreements with some clients, we can\'t publish all success stories publicly, but we\'ll share relevant examples from your industry during our consultation.',
    category: 'General'
  },
  {
    id: 'faq15',
    question: 'What\'s included in the free AI visibility check?',
    answer: 'During your free strategy call, we\'ll run live queries on ChatGPT and other AI platforms to show exactly where you rank right now for relevant business searches in your area. We\'ll also identify the top 3 gaps preventing you from ranking higher and outline a custom roadmap to fix them.',
